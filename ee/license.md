# Overview


## MIT
The MIT License is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable.

jQuery, .NET Core, and Rails use the MIT License.

## Apache V2.0
The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.

Android, Apache, and Swift use the Apache License 2.0.

## GNU GPLv3
The GNU GPLv3 is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms,
and also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.

Bash, GIMP, and Privacy Badger use the GNU GPLv3.
